## Introduction to Browsers and Website Rendering

### Browsers

* **Definition:** Software applications designed to retrieve, present, and traverse information on the World Wide Web.
* **Rendering Engine:** The component responsible for interpreting HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to display webpages.

  * Examples: WebKit (Safari), Blink (Chrome), Gecko (Firefox)
* **Primary Function:** Execute client-side scripts (JavaScript) and render the Document Object Model (DOM) based on received HTML and CSS.

## Web Communication (Client-Server Model)

### Client

* The browser or user agent making requests.

### Server

* The machine responding with the requested resources.

### HTTP/HTTPS

* Protocols used for transmitting requests and responses.

### URL (Uniform Resource Locator)

* **Structure:** Protocol (http/https), domain name, path, optional query parameters.
* **Purpose:** Identifies the resource's location on the server.

---

## Web Page Lifecycle

1. **Request Initiation:** User enters a URL or clicks a link.
2. **Request Sent:** Browser parses the URL and sends an HTTP/HTTPS request to the server.
3. **Server Response:** Server returns HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and metadata in the response headers.

### Response Headers Include:

* Content type
* Status code
* Caching policies

---

## Rendering Process

1. **HTML Parsing:** Browser constructs the DOM.
2. **CSS Parsing:** CSS is processed to create the CSSOM.
3. **JavaScript Execution:** Scripts run and can modify the DOM/CSSOM.
4. **Layout and Painting:** Browser computes layout and paints pixels on screen.

## Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

### Definition

A comprehensive software suite consolidating essential development tools.

### Features

* **Code Editor:** Syntax highlighting, auto-completion, refactoring tools.
* **Debugger:** Step-through debugging, breakpoints.
* **Build Automation Tools:** Automates repetitive tasks.
* **Version Control:** Git integration for source code management.

### Examples

* Visual Studio Code
* IntelliJ IDEA
* Sublime Text

---

## HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

### HTML (HyperText Markup Language)

* Structures web pages using elements and attributes.
* Promotes semantic markup for accessibility and SEO.

### CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)

* Styles and layouts for web pages.
* Responsive design via media queries and flexible grids.

### JavaScript

* Client-side scripting for interactivity.
* DOM manipulation, event handling, AJAX for asynchronous operations.

---

## Projects Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

* **Interactive Forms:** Validations, conditional rendering.
* **Single Page Applications (SPAs):** Built with React, Angular, Vue.js.
* **Responsive Design:** Compatible across devices and screen sizes.
* **API Integration:** Fetch and manipulate external data.

---

## Additional Points

### Goal of a Website

* Enables one user to communicate with another computer.
* When a site loads, the server sends HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### Goal of the Browser

* Allows users to access servers anywhere via unique URLs.
* Renders HTML, CSS, and JavaScript returned by the server.
